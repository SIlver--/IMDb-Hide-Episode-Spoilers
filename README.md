IMDb-Hide-Episode-Spoilers
==========================
Ever want to look up who the actor is for your new favorite TV show on IMDb? But uh-oh! 
You just noticed that the show has 40 episodes and the character(although he's been in 
every episode so far) is only in 28. Thanks for the spoiler alert IMDb! This extension 
will hide those pesky spoilers out of view unless you hover over it. And a simple button 
allows you to turn off all the spoiler tags if you're not worried about that show. 
Easy and simple.
